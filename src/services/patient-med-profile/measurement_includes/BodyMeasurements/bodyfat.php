<p>
    The body fat percentage (BFP) of a human or other living being is the total
    mass of fat divided by total body mass; body fat includes essential body fat
    and storage body fat. Essential body fat is necessary to maintain life and
    reproductive functions. The percentage of essential body fat for women is
    greater than that for men, due to the demands of childbearing and other
    hormonal functions. The percentage of essential fat is 3–5% in men, and 8–12%
    in women (referenced through NASM). Storage body fat consists of fat
    accumulation in adipose tissue, part of which protects internal organs in
    the chest and abdomen. The minimum recommended total body fat percentage
    exceeds the essential fat percentage value reported above. A number of
    methods are available for determining body fat percentage, such as
    measurement with calipers or through the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis.
